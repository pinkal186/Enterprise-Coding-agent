# **Engineering Agent — System Design Document**

## **1\. Purpose**

Engineering Agent is an independent, provider-agnostic coding agent built from the ground up to understand how coding agents work.

The system will be developed incrementally through working implementations, repeatable tests, agent-task evaluations, and failure analysis.

The primary objective is learning through implementation:

Build a minimal working coding agent, understand each important component through implementation and testing, and gradually evolve it into a capable and extensible agent.

The system is not intended to clone Pi, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or any other existing product.

---

## **2\. System Goals**

Engineering Agent should:

* Accept coding tasks through a CLI  
* Inspect repositories and source code  
* Search for relevant files and symbols  
* Read selected file content  
* Modify or create files  
* Execute commands and tests  
* Interpret tool results  
* Recover from failures  
* Maintain useful task context  
* Verify changes before reporting success  
* Support multiple LLM providers  
* Provide structured logging and evaluation  
* Remain extensible as new capabilities are added

The system should prioritize transparency, testability, safety, and learning over feature count.

---

## **3\. Non-Goals**

The initial system will not attempt to:

* Replace established coding agents  
* Depend on a single LLM provider  
* Read entire repositories by default  
* Automatically perform unsafe operations  
* Add RAG, memory, sub-agents, or complex planning before the core loop is understood  
* Optimize for maximum autonomy before reliability is established  
* Treat every proposed feature as necessary

Future capabilities must be justified by learning value, practical value, or measurable improvement.

---

## **4\. High-Level Architecture**

The system will use the following logical architecture:

User  
  |  
  v  
CLI Interface  
  |  
  v  
Agent Runtime  
  |  
  \+--\> Context Manager  
  |  
  \+--\> Agent Loop  
  |      |  
  |      \+--\> LLM Interface  
  |      |      |  
  |      |      \+--\> Provider Adapter  
  |      |             |  
  |      |             \+--\> Model API  
  |      |  
  |      \+--\> Tool Registry  
  |             |  
  |             \+--\> File Tools  
  |             \+--\> Search Tools  
  |             \+--\> Command Tools  
  |             \+--\> Git Tools  
  |  
  \+--\> Verification and Evaluation  
  |  
  \+--\> Logging and Failure Analysis

The architecture should keep the agent loop independent from provider-specific APIs and tool implementation details.

---

## **5\. Core Components**

### **5.1 CLI Interface**

The CLI is the primary user-facing interface for the MVP.

Responsibilities:

* Accept a user task  
* Select or validate the working directory  
* Configure the provider and model  
* Display agent progress  
* Display tool actions and results  
* Report final status  
* Support debug or verbose logging  
* Return an appropriate process exit code

Example usage:

engineering-agent "Fix the failing test in the parser module"

The CLI should not contain agent reasoning logic. It should delegate execution to the agent runtime.

---

### **5.2 Agent Runtime**

The agent runtime coordinates the major system components.

Responsibilities:

* Create a task session  
* Initialize context  
* Start the agent loop  
* Register available tools  
* Enforce execution limits  
* Track task state  
* Trigger verification  
* Produce a final result  
* Record structured events

The runtime should provide a stable boundary between the CLI and the internal agent implementation.

---

### **5.3 LLM Interface**

The LLM interface provides a provider-independent abstraction.

Conceptually:

Agent Loop  
    |  
    v  
LLM Interface  
    |  
    v  
Provider Adapter  
    |  
    v  
Model

The interface should support:

* Sending conversation messages  
* Supplying tool definitions  
* Receiving text responses  
* Receiving structured tool calls  
* Reporting usage metadata when available  
* Handling provider errors  
* Supporting configurable model parameters

A provider adapter must translate between the internal interface and the provider's API format.

The agent loop must not directly import or depend on Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, or another provider SDK.

---

### **5.4 Provider Adapters**

The first provider adapter will target Gemini.

Future adapters may support:

* OpenAI  
* Claude  
* Groq  
* Local models  
* Other compatible providers

Each adapter is responsible for:

* Authentication  
* Request formatting  
* Tool-call translation  
* Response parsing  
* Error normalization  
* Usage reporting  
* Provider-specific retry behavior

Changing providers should not require changes to the agent loop, tools, context manager, or evaluation framework.

---

### **5.5 Agent Loop**

The agent loop is the core execution mechanism.

Basic flow:

1\. Receive user request  
2\. Build the initial context  
3\. Send context and available tools to the LLM  
4\. Inspect the LLM response  
5\. If the response requests a tool:  
   a. Validate the tool call  
   b. Apply safety checks  
   c. Execute the tool  
   d. Record the result  
   e. Add the result to context  
   f. Continue the loop  
6\. If the response contains a final answer:  
   a. Run required verification  
   b. Determine whether the task is complete  
   c. Return the result  
7\. Stop on success, failure, cancellation, or configured limits

The loop must support:

* Maximum iteration limits  
* Tool-call validation  
* Tool execution errors  
* Provider errors  
* Repeated failed actions  
* Cancellation  
* Context limits  
* Explicit completion status  
* Verification before success

The agent must not declare a coding task successful solely because the LLM produced a confident final message.

---

### **5.6 Tool Registry**

Tools should be registered through a common interface.

Each tool should define:

* Name  
* Description  
* Input schema  
* Execution function  
* Permission requirements  
* Output limits  
* Error behavior  
* Safety classification

The tool registry should allow tools to be added or removed without modifying the agent loop.

Initial tools:

* Read file  
* Search files  
* Search code  
* Write file  
* Edit file  
* Run command

Future tools:

* File discovery  
* Symbol navigation  
* Git status  
* Git diff  
* Git commit  
* Git push  
* External knowledge retrieval  
* Memory access  
* Sub-agent delegation

---

## **6\. Initial Tool Design**

### **6.1 Read File**

Purpose:

* Read a selected file or file section  
* Avoid loading unnecessary repository content  
* Limit output size

Inputs may include:

* File path  
* Start line  
* End line  
* Maximum output size

Safety requirements:

* Restrict access to the configured workspace by default  
* Reject paths outside the workspace unless explicitly permitted  
* Report missing files clearly  
* Truncate oversized output with an explicit notice

---

### **6.2 Search Files and Code**

Purpose:

* Locate relevant files, symbols, strings, and patterns  
* Encourage search-before-read behavior  
* Reduce unnecessary context usage

Inputs may include:

* Search query  
* Search path  
* File pattern  
* Case sensitivity  
* Maximum results

The tool should return concise, structured results containing:

* File path  
* Line number  
* Matching text or symbol  
* Result count  
* Truncation status

---

### **6.3 Write or Edit File**

Purpose:

* Create or modify source files  
* Apply targeted changes  
* Preserve unrelated content

The system should prefer precise edits over replacing entire files.

Safety requirements:

* Validate paths  
* Record the original state when possible  
* Show or log the intended change  
* Reject malformed edit requests  
* Prevent accidental writes outside the workspace  
* Support dry-run behavior in future versions

---

### **6.4 Run Command**

Purpose:

* Execute tests, builds, linters, formatters, and other development commands  
* Provide feedback for verification and recovery

Inputs may include:

* Command  
* Working directory  
* Timeout  
* Environment configuration

Safety requirements:

* Apply command restrictions  
* Enforce timeouts  
* Capture stdout and stderr  
* Limit output size  
* Record exit code  
* Distinguish timeout, failure, and successful execution  
* Require confirmation for high-risk commands when appropriate

The initial implementation should use an explicit command policy rather than unrestricted shell access.

---

## **7\. Context Management**

Context management is responsible for deciding what information is sent to the LLM.

The initial context should include:

* System instructions  
* User request  
* Current task state  
* Available tools  
* Relevant tool results  
* Relevant file content  
* Verification results  
* Important failure information

The system should avoid:

* Reading the entire repository  
* Repeating identical tool results  
* Including irrelevant files  
* Sending unbounded command output  
* Retaining every historical message indefinitely

Future context capabilities include:

* Token estimation  
* Context budgets  
* Relevance-based selection  
* Output truncation  
* Context compaction  
* State preservation  
* Resume support  
* Input/output usage measurement

The system must distinguish between:

Active context: information currently supplied to the model  
Persistent memory: information stored for future tasks or sessions

These are separate capabilities and should not be conflated.

---

## **8\. Task State**

Each task session should maintain explicit state.

Possible state fields:

* Task identifier  
* User request  
* Workspace path  
* Current phase  
* Conversation history  
* Tool-call history  
* Files inspected  
* Files modified  
* Commands executed  
* Verification results  
* Failure classifications  
* Token usage  
* Iteration count  
* Completion status  
* Cancellation status

Example task phases:

initialized  
investigating  
planning  
editing  
verifying  
recovering  
completed  
failed  
cancelled

The MVP may use a simple state model. More advanced planning and resume behavior can be added later.

---

## **9\. Verification**

Verification is required before a task is considered complete.

Verification may include:

* Running targeted tests  
* Running the project test suite  
* Running a build  
* Running a linter  
* Inspecting the resulting diff  
* Confirming expected files changed  
* Checking that unrelated files were not modified

The verification strategy should depend on the task and repository.

A successful final response should distinguish between:

* Changes made  
* Verification performed  
* Verification passed  
* Verification failed  
* Verification not performed  
* Remaining uncertainty

The agent must not claim that a task is complete when verification failed or was skipped without clearly stating that fact.

---

## **10\. Error Handling and Recovery**

Errors should be represented as structured events rather than plain text whenever possible.

Error categories include:

* Invalid tool input  
* Missing file  
* Search failure  
* File write failure  
* Command failure  
* Command timeout  
* Provider failure  
* Authentication failure  
* Rate limit  
* Context overflow  
* Tool permission denial  
* Repeated action  
* Agent iteration limit  
* Unsafe operation attempt

Recovery behavior may include:

* Returning the error to the LLM  
* Retrying transient provider failures  
* Asking for clarification  
* Adjusting the command or tool input  
* Reducing output size  
* Replanning the task  
* Stopping after repeated failure  
* Reporting incomplete work

The system should prevent infinite loops by tracking repeated actions and enforcing iteration limits.

---

## **11\. Safety Model**

Safety should be introduced early and strengthened over time.

Initial safety controls:

* Workspace boundary enforcement  
* Command allowlist or policy  
* Timeouts  
* Output limits  
* Maximum agent iterations  
* Tool input validation  
* Explicit logging  
* No automatic Git push  
* No destructive operations by default

Higher-risk operations should require explicit confirmation or a future permission mechanism.

Examples:

* Deleting files  
* Modifying files outside the workspace  
* Installing packages  
* Changing system configuration  
* Running network commands  
* Committing changes  
* Pushing changes  
* Executing destructive shell commands

The agent should favor reversible actions and provide enough information for the user to understand what occurred.

---

## **12\. Logging and Observability**

The system should produce structured logs for each task.

Important events include:

* Task started  
* User request received  
* LLM request sent  
* LLM response received  
* Tool selected  
* Tool input validated  
* Tool started  
* Tool completed  
* Tool failed  
* File changed  
* Command executed  
* Verification started  
* Verification completed  
* Context compacted  
* Retry performed  
* Failure classified  
* Task completed  
* Task failed

Logs should support:

* Debugging  
* Performance analysis  
* Token analysis  
* Failure analysis  
* Reproducibility  
* Evaluation comparison

Sensitive information such as API keys must never be written to logs.

---

## **13\. Evaluation Framework**

Evaluation must include both software tests and real agent tasks.

### **13.1 Unit Tests**

Unit tests should cover:

* LLM interface behavior  
* Provider adapter translation  
* Tool input validation  
* File path safety  
* Search behavior  
* File editing  
* Command execution  
* Output truncation  
* Context management  
* State transitions  
* Error normalization  
* Iteration limits  
* Logging behavior

### **13.2 Integration Tests**

Integration tests should cover:

* Agent loop with mocked LLM responses  
* Tool-call execution  
* Tool errors returned to the model  
* Multi-step tasks  
* Verification behavior  
* Provider adapter integration  
* Context-limit behavior

### **13.3 Agent Task Tests**

Agent task tests should use representative coding tasks such as:

* Find and fix a small bug  
* Add a missing function  
* Update a test  
* Refactor a small module  
* Diagnose a failing command  
* Modify configuration safely

Each task should define:

* Initial repository state  
* User request  
* Expected files or behavior  
* Allowed commands  
* Verification command  
* Success criteria  
* Failure categories  
* Token or time budget where relevant

### **13.4 Repeatability**

A single successful run is insufficient.

Evaluation should measure:

* Success rate across repeated runs  
* Correctness  
* Unrelated modifications  
* Verification success  
* Number of tool calls  
* Number of retries  
* Token usage  
* Execution time  
* Safety violations  
* Failure category distribution

---

## **14\. Failure Analysis Framework**

Failures should be classified consistently.

Initial categories:

* Request misunderstanding  
* Incorrect repository navigation  
* Wrong file selection  
* Wrong tool selection  
* Invalid tool input  
* Incorrect code generation  
* Unrelated modification  
* Ignored tool result  
* Misinterpreted test failure  
* Repeated failed action  
* Lost context  
* Excessive context usage  
* Unsafe command  
* Missing verification  
* False success declaration  
* Provider failure  
* Agent loop deadlock  
* Iteration limit exceeded

Each failure record should include:

* Task identifier  
* Failure category  
* Relevant events  
* Last successful action  
* First incorrect action  
* Expected behavior  
* Actual behavior  
* Likely cause  
* Proposed improvement  
* Whether the failure was reproduced

The purpose is to improve the system based on evidence rather than intuition.

* Tool-output size  
* Context size  
* Number of repeated actions  
* Time per task  
* Cost where available

Model routing and switching are not required initially. They may be evaluated later after the basic system is understood.

---

## **17\. Prioritization Framework**

Proposed capabilities should be evaluated using a 2×2 matrix:

                High learning/practical value  
                              |  
                              |  
Low complexity/risk \----------+---------- High complexity/risk  
                              |  
                              |  
                 Low learning/practical value

The matrix should be used when planning iterations or evaluating new feature ideas.

Features should be prioritized when they:

* Teach an important agent mechanism  
* Provide measurable practical value  
* Have manageable implementation risk  
* Improve reliability or safety  
* Enable meaningful evaluation

Features should be deferred when they are fashionable but poorly understood, difficult to evaluate, or unrelated to the project's learning objectives.

---

## **18\. Evaluation Matrices**

### **18.1 Known / Unknown × Value**

Tasks should be classified according to:

* How well the problem is understood  
* How valuable solving it is

This matrix helps select representative evaluation tasks and prioritize learning.

It is a project-level evaluation tool, not a mandatory step for every iteration.

### **18.2 Reliability / Risk Matrix**

Tasks and capabilities should also be evaluated according to:

* Likelihood of agent failure  
* Impact of failure

High-likelihood, high-impact areas should receive stronger controls, more testing, and clearer permissions.

This matrix should be applied selectively, especially to:

* File modification  
* Command execution  
* Git operations  
* External access  
* Persistent memory  
* Autonomous retries

---

## **19\. Configuration**

Configuration should be externalized where practical.

Potential configuration values:

* Provider  
* Model  
* API credentials  
* Workspace path  
* Maximum iterations  
* Command timeout  
* Tool output limits  
* Context budget  
* Logging level  
* Allowed commands  
* Confirmation policy  
* Verification commands  
* Evaluation mode

Configuration should have safe defaults and should not expose secrets through logs or error messages.

---

## **20\. Project Success Criteria**

The project is successful when:

* The core agent loop is understood through implementation  
* The system can complete small coding tasks  
* Provider-specific code is isolated  
* Tools are independently testable  
* Agent behavior is observable  
* Failures are classified and measured  
* Verification is part of task completion  
* Context and token usage are measurable  
* New capabilities can be added incrementally  
* Safety controls prevent avoidable destructive actions  
* Evaluation results guide future development

The primary success criterion is:

Do we understand how a coding agent works because we built and tested its important parts ourselves?

A useful general-purpose coding agent, including one capable of assisting with difficult legacy-code or bug-fixing work, is a valuable secondary outcome.
