# **Engineering Agent — Iteration 1 Technical Implementation Plan**

## **1\. Iteration 1 Goal**

Build the **minimum working coding agent** that can:

1. Accept a coding task from the CLI.  
2. Send the task to an LLM.  
3. Let the LLM choose from a small set of tools.  
4. Inspect a repository.  
5. Read files.  
6. Search files/code.  
7. Modify files.  
8. Run a command/test.  
9. Observe the result.  
10. Continue the agent loop when necessary.  
11. Stop when the task is complete or a safety/iteration limit is reached.  
12. Report what happened.

The objective is **not** to build a feature-rich coding agent.

The objective is to create the smallest complete system that demonstrates the real coding-agent loop.

# **2\. MVP Definition**

The MVP consists of:

CLI  
 |  
 v  
Agent Runtime  
 |  
 \+---- Agent Loop  
 |  
 \+---- Context  
 |  
 \+---- LLM Interface  
 |       |  
 |       \+---- Gemini Provider  
 |  
 \+---- Tool Registry  
         |  
         \+---- Search  
         \+---- Read File  
         \+---- Edit/Write File  
         \+---- Run Command

The MVP must work against a real local repository.

---

# **3\. Technology**

## **Required**

* **TypeScript**  
* **Node.js**  
* **npm**  
* CLI application  
* Git for source control  
* Gemini API as the first provider

## **Recommended libraries**

Use simple, well-maintained libraries rather than building infrastructure unnecessarily.

Suggested:

* TypeScript  
* Node.js  
* `tsx` for development execution  
* `vitest` for tests  
* `zod` for input validation  
* Gemini's official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for the Gemini adapter  
* Native Node.js filesystem/process APIs where practical

Do not introduce an agent framework.

The purpose of this project is to implement the agent runtime ourselves.

---

# **4\. Provider Independence**

The most important architectural rule is:

The Agent Loop must not know which LLM provider is being used.

The architecture should be:

Agent Loop  
    |  
    v  
LLM Interface  
    |  
    v  
Provider Adapter  
    |  
    v  
Gemini API

Later:

LLM Interface  
    |  
    \+-- Gemini  
    \+-- OpenAI  
    \+-- Claude  
    \+-- Groq  
    \+-- Local Model

Only the Gemini adapter should contain Gemini-specific API code.

Do not call the Gemini SDK directly from:

* Agent Loop  
* Tools  
* CLI  
* Context Manager  
* Evaluation code

---

# **5\. Suggested Project Structure**

Create the project approximately as follows:

engineering-agent/  
│  
├── src/  
│   ├── cli/  
│   │   └── main.ts  
│   │  
│   ├── agent/  
│   │   ├── agent.ts  
│   │   ├── loop.ts  
│   │   └── state.ts  
│   │  
│   ├── llm/  
│   │   ├── types.ts  
│   │   ├── provider.ts  
│   │   └── gemini.ts  
│   │  
│   ├── tools/  
│   │   ├── types.ts  
│   │   ├── registry.ts

│   │   ├── edit-file.ts  
│   │   └── run-command.ts  
│   │  
│   ├── context/  
│   │   └── context.ts  
│   │  
│   ├── safety/

│   └── tasks/  
│  
├── package.json  
├── tsconfig.json  
├── .env.example  
├── .gitignore  
└── README.md

The implementation can change this structure if there is a strong technical reason, but responsibilities should remain separated.

---

# **6\. Core Data Types**

Create internal types that are independent of Gemini.

## **Message**

Conceptually:

Message  
\- role  
\- content  
\- optional tool call  
\- optional tool result

Supported roles initially:

system  
user  
assistant  
tool

## **Tool Call**

ToolCall  
\- id  
\- toolName  
\- arguments

## **Tool Result**

ToolResult  
\- toolCallId  
\- success  
\- output  
\- error

## **LLM Response**

LLMResponse  
\- type: "text" | "tool\_call"  
\- text?  
\- toolCall?  
\- usage?

The exact TypeScript representation is up to the developer, but the provider adapter must convert Gemini responses into these internal structures.

---

# **7\. LLM Interface**

Define a provider-independent interface.

Conceptually:

LLMProvider.generate(  
    messages,  
    tools,  
    options  
) \-\> LLMResponse

The interface should support:

* Messages  
* Tool definitions  
* Model name  
* Temperature/configuration where supported  
* Maximum output configuration where supported  
* Usage information where available

The interface should also normalize provider errors.

For example:

ProviderError  
\- type  
\- message  
\- retryable  
\- provider

Do not expose Gemini-specific response objects outside the Gemini adapter.

---

# **8\. Gemini Adapter**

Implement the first provider using Gemini.

Responsibilities:

1. Read API configuration securely.  
2. Convert internal messages to Gemini format.  
3. Convert internal tool definitions to Gemini function/tool definitions.  
4. Send the request.  
5. Parse normal text responses.  
6. Parse tool calls.  
7. Convert usage information into the internal format.  
8. Normalize errors.

Configuration should come from environment/configuration rather than source code.

Example:

GEMINI\_API\_KEY  
GEMINI\_MODEL

Do not commit API keys.

---

# **9\. Tool Interface**

Every tool should implement the same conceptual contract:

Tool  
\- name  
\- description  
\- input schema  
\- execute(input, context)

The tool registry should provide:

register(tool)  
get(toolName)  
list()

The Agent Loop should ask the registry for tools.

It should not directly instantiate individual tools.

---

# **10\. MVP Tools**

Only four capabilities are required.

## **Tool 1 — Search**

Purpose:

Find relevant files/code before reading them.

Input:

query  
path?  
filePattern?  
maxResults?

Output:

file  
line  
matching text

Requirements:

* Search only inside the workspace.  
* Limit number of results.  
* Limit total output size.  
* Clearly indicate when results were truncated.  
* Handle no results cleanly.

Use an existing local search command if appropriate rather than implementing a complete code-search engine.

---

# **11\. Tool 2 — Read File**

Input:

path  
startLine?  
endLine?

Requirements:

* Workspace boundary check.  
* File existence check.  
* Maximum output size.  
* Clear error messages.  
* Support reading only part of a file.

The tool should discourage unnecessarily loading huge files.

If output is truncated, return something like:

\[Output truncated. File contains additional content.\]

---

# **12\. Tool 3 — Edit/Write File**

The MVP should support creating and modifying files.

Prefer targeted edits where practical.

Input should contain enough information to make the change unambiguous.

For example:

path  
operation  
content / edit instructions

Requirements:

* Validate workspace path.  
* Reject unsafe paths.  
* Detect invalid edit requests.  
* Return success/failure.  
* Record modified files.  
* Do not silently modify unrelated files.

For MVP, simple deterministic editing is preferable to building a complex patch engine.

---

# **13\. Tool 4 — Run Command**

Purpose:

Allow the agent to verify its work.

Input:

command  
workingDirectory?  
timeout?

Output:

exitCode  
stdout  
stderr  
timedOut

Requirements:

* Workspace restriction.  
* Timeout.  
* Output limit.  
* Capture stdout/stderr.  
* Return exit code.  
* Clearly distinguish successful execution from command failure.

Do not initially allow unrestricted dangerous commands.

Create a simple command policy.

Examples of potentially allowed commands:

npm test  
npm run test  
npm run build  
npm run lint  
node ...

The exact policy should be configurable.

---

# **14\. Agent State**

The MVP needs only simple task state.

Example:

AgentState  
\- taskId  
\- userRequest  
\- workspace  
\- messages  
\- iterationCount  
\- modifiedFiles  
\- executedCommands  
\- status

Status:

running  
completed  
failed  
cancelled

Do not build persistent memory yet.

---

# **15\. Agent Loop Implementation**

The core loop should behave approximately as follows:

START  
 |  
 v  
Create task state  
 |  
 v  
Create initial context  
 |  
 v  
Send request \+ tools to LLM  
 |  
 v  
Receive response  
 |  
 \+------ Text \------\> Is task complete?  
 |                         |  
 |                         \+-- Yes \--\> Verify \--\> Finish  
 |                         |  
 |                         \+-- No \--\> Continue  
 |  
 \+---- Tool Call  
          |  
          v  
     Validate tool  
          |  
          v  
     Safety check  
          |  
          v  
     Execute tool  
          |  
          v  
     Capture result  
          |  
          v  
     Add result to context  
          |  
          v  
     Increment iteration  
          |  
          v  
     Send context to LLM

This is the most important component of Iteration 1\.

---

# **16\. Loop Limits**

The agent must never run forever.

Add:

MAX\_AGENT\_ITERATIONS

For MVP, use a conservative default such as:

20 iterations

The limit should be configurable.

If the limit is reached:

status \= failed  
reason \= iteration\_limit

The final response must clearly say that the agent stopped because it reached its limit.

---

# **17\. Repeated Failure Protection**

The MVP should detect obvious repeated failures.

Example:

Agent:  
run npm test

Result:  
test failed

Agent:  
run npm test

Result:  
same failure

Agent:  
run npm test

This should not continue indefinitely.

Track repeated identical or substantially identical actions.

After a configurable number of repeated failures, stop and report:

Agent stopped because the same failing action was repeated.

More sophisticated recovery can be added later.

---

# **18\. Context for MVP**

Do not implement sophisticated context management yet.

The MVP context should contain:

System instructions  
\+  
User task  
\+  
Available tools  
\+  
Previous assistant responses  
\+  
Tool calls  
\+  
Tool results

However, basic limits must exist.

At minimum:

* Maximum tool output size  
* Maximum file-read size  
* Maximum conversation/iteration limit

Do not implement RAG, embeddings, vector databases, or advanced compaction in Iteration 1\.

The purpose is to establish the baseline before adding those capabilities.

---

# **19\. Initial System Instructions**

Create a simple system prompt.

It should tell the model:

* It is a coding agent.  
* It has access to the provided tools.  
* It should inspect before modifying.  
* It should make minimal changes.  
* It should use search before reading large amounts of code.  
* It should run relevant tests after changes.  
* It should not claim success without verification.  
* It should not use unavailable tools.  
* It should stop when the task is complete.

Keep this prompt short.

Do not attempt to reproduce Claude Code or Pi system prompts.

---

# **20\. Basic Safety Policy**

The MVP must have basic protection.

## **File safety**

Allow:

workspace/\*\*

Reject:

../../outside-workspace

Resolve paths before accessing them.

## **Command safety**

Commands should pass through a policy before execution.

The policy should be able to return:

ALLOW  
DENY  
CONFIRM

For MVP:

* Safe development commands → ALLOW  
* Clearly destructive commands → DENY  
* Higher-risk commands → CONFIRM or DENY

The exact policy should be easy to extend later.

---

# **21\. CLI**

The first CLI should be extremely simple.

Example:

engineering-agent "Fix the failing test in calculator.ts"

Optional:

engineering-agent \--workspace ./my-project "Fix the failing test"

Optional configuration:

engineering-agent \--model \<model\> "Add validation to the user service"

The CLI should display useful progress such as:

Task: Fix the failing test

→ Thinking  
→ Search: calculator  
→ Read: src/calculator.ts  
→ Edit: src/calculator.ts  
→ Run: npm test  
→ Test passed

Task completed.

Do not build a web UI.

---

# **22\. Logging**

For every agent run, log structured events.

At minimum:

task\_started  
llm\_request  
llm\_response  
tool\_requested  
tool\_started  
tool\_completed  
tool\_failed  
verification\_started  
verification\_completed  
task\_completed  
task\_failed

The log should include:

* Task ID  
* Timestamp  
* Iteration number  
* Tool name  
* Success/failure  
* Duration  
* Output size  
* Token usage if available

Never log API keys.

---

# **23\. Task Progress Checklist**

Maintain a progress file at the repository root:

IMPLEMENTATION\_PROGRESS.md

This file must contain a checklist of every implementation, testing, evaluation, and acceptance task in this plan.

Use GitHub-style checkboxes:

\- \[ \] Create TypeScript/Node project  
\- \[ \] Implement internal LLM types/interfaces  
\- \[x\] Implement Gemini provider adapter

Requirements:

* Add one checklist item for every meaningful task.  
* Mark an item `[x]` only after the task is actually completed and verified.  
* Keep incomplete, blocked, or partially completed items as `[ ]`.  
* Add a short `Status`, `Notes`, or `Next action` section when useful.  
* Record blockers, failed attempts, and the exact next step when work is interrupted.  
* Update this file after completing each implementation or verification step, not only at the end.  
* Before starting work, read this file to determine what remains pending.  
* If an agent is interrupted, the next agent must be able to resume from this file without reconstructing progress from chat history.  
* Do not mark a parent task complete while any required subtask remains incomplete.  
* Include the current date or timestamp for significant progress updates.  
* Keep the checklist synchronized with the actual repository state.

The progress file should include, at minimum:

---

# **24\. Unit Testing**

Before testing the complete agent, implement unit tests for each component.

## **LLM**

Test:

* Normal response parsing  
* Tool-call parsing  
* Provider error handling  
* Invalid response handling

Mock the provider API.

## **Search**

Test:

* Match found  
* No match  
* Maximum results  
* Output truncation  
* Workspace restriction

## **Read File**

Test:

* Existing file  
* Missing file  
* Partial read  
* Large file  
* Outside workspace

## **Edit/Write**

Test:

* Create file  
* Modify file  
* Invalid path  
* Invalid input  
* Workspace restriction

## **Run Command**

Test:

* Successful command  
* Failed command  
* Timeout  
* Output capture  
* Command policy rejection

## **Agent Loop**

Test:

LLM → tool → result → LLM → final response

Use a mocked LLM.

Also test:

* Tool failure  
* Provider failure  
* Iteration limit  
* Repeated failure  
* Final verification

Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` after each test group is implemented and passing.

---

# **25\. Integration Test**

Create a small test repository fixture.

Example:

test-project/  
├── src/  
│   └── calculator.ts  
├── tests/  
│   └── calculator.test.ts  
└── package.json

Introduce a deliberate small bug.

Example task:

Fix the failing calculator test.

The agent should:

Search  
 ↓  
Read  
 ↓  
Understand  
 ↓  
Edit  
 ↓  
Run test  
 ↓  
Observe result  
 ↓  
Finish

This becomes the first complete end-to-end test.

Record the integration test result in `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`.

---

# **26\. Agent Evaluation Task Set**

Create at least **5 small coding tasks**.

Each task must have:

Task ID  
Repository fixture  
User request  
Expected behavior  
Expected verification command  
Success criteria

Suggested tasks:

### **Task 1 — Bug Fix**

Fix a small incorrect calculation.

### **Task 2 — Add Function**

Add a missing function with a provided test.

### **Task 3 — Modify Existing Function**

Change existing behavior without breaking current tests.

### **Task 4 — Test Failure Diagnosis**

Identify why a test fails and fix it.

### **Task 5 — Small Refactor**

Refactor a small piece of code while preserving tests.

Keep the tasks small enough that failures can be understood manually.

Track each task's creation and validation status in `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`.

---

# **27\. Agent Test Procedure**

Every evaluation task should follow:

1\. Reset repository to clean state  
2\. Start agent  
3\. Give exact task  
4\. Record agent actions  
5\. Allow agent to complete  
6\. Run independent verification  
7\. Compare expected vs actual result  
8\. Record success/failure  
9\. Analyze failure if unsuccessful  
10\. Repeat the task

The independent verification step is important.

Do not trust the agent's final message as the test result.

Record the outcome of every run in the progress file or linked evaluation report so that an interrupted agent can resume evaluation without losing completed results.

---

# **28\. Multiple Test Rounds**

A single successful run does not prove reliability.

For the initial benchmark:

Run each task multiple times

Record:

* Success/failure  
* Number of iterations  
* Tool calls  
* Test result  
* Time  
* Token usage if available  
* Failure type

Example:

Task: Fix calculator bug

Run 1: PASS  
Run 2: PASS  
Run 3: FAIL  
Run 4: PASS  
Run 5: PASS

Success rate: 80%

The exact number of repetitions can be adjusted based on API limits.

Update the checklist after each task and test round, including partial results.

---

# **29\. Failure Analysis**

When an agent test fails, do not immediately modify the implementation.

First identify:

What did the agent believe?  
What did it do?  
What should it have done?  
Where did the first incorrect decision occur?

Classify the failure.

Initial categories:

UNDERSTANDING  
SEARCH  
FILE\_SELECTION  
TOOL\_SELECTION  
TOOL\_INPUT  
CODE\_CHANGE  
TEST\_INTERPRETATION  
RECOVERY  
CONTEXT  
SAFETY  
FALSE\_SUCCESS  
LOOP  
PROVIDER

Example:

Task:  
Fix parser bug

Failure:  
Agent modified parser.test.ts instead of parser.ts

Category:  
FILE\_SELECTION

First incorrect action:  
Selected test file as implementation target

Likely cause:  
Insufficient repository inspection

Potential improvement:  
Improve search/instruction/context

This analysis becomes input to the next development decision.

Record each failure analysis and resulting action in `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`.

---

# **30\. MVP Success Criteria**

Iteration 1 is successful only when all of the following work:

### **Core**

* CLI starts successfully.  
* User can provide a coding task.  
* LLM provider can be changed through configuration/interface.  
* Gemini adapter works.  
* Agent loop executes multiple iterations.  
* Tool calls work.  
* Tool results return to the LLM.  
* Agent can modify code.  
* Agent can execute a verification command.  
* Agent can complete a small coding task.

### **Safety**

* Workspace boundaries work.  
* Command policy works.  
* Iteration limit works.  
* Repeated-failure protection works.

### **Testing**

* Unit tests pass.  
* Integration tests pass.  
* At least five agent evaluation tasks exist.  
* Independent verification is used.  
* Failures are classified.

### **Observability**

* Agent actions are logged.  
* Tool calls are visible.  
* Iteration count is visible.  
* Final result clearly indicates success/failure.

### **Progress Tracking**

* `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` exists.  
* Every implementation step has a checklist item.  
* Completed tasks are marked `[x]`.  
* Pending and partially completed tasks remain `[ ]`.  
* The file identifies the current step and next action.  
* An interrupted agent can resume from the progress file.

---

# **31\. What NOT to Build in Iteration 1**

Do not add:

* RAG  
* Vector database  
* Embeddings  
* Persistent memory  
* Sub-agents  
* Model routing  
* Automatic model switching  
* MCP  
* Complex planning  
* Complex skill system  
* Plugin marketplace  
* Web UI  
* Autonomous background execution  
* Automatic Git push  
* Sophisticated context compaction  
* Large-scale repository indexing

These are deliberately deferred.

The purpose of Iteration 1 is to establish the baseline.

---

# **32\. Git in Iteration 1**

Git should be used for the **Engineering Agent project's own source code**, but advanced Git-agent capabilities are deferred.

The developer should:

git init  
git add .  
git commit \-m "Initial Engineering Agent MVP"

The implementation should be committed after the MVP passes its tests.

A remote push can be performed manually by the developer:

git remote add origin \<repository\>  
git push \-u origin main

Do not build automatic `git commit` or `git push` agent tools in Iteration 1\.

Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` before and after the MVP commit, including the commit hash once available.

---

# **33\. Implementation Order**

The coding agent should implement in this order:

### **Step 1**

Create TypeScript/Node project and initialize `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`.

### **Step 2**

Create project structure.

### **Step 3**

Create internal LLM types/interfaces.

### **Step 4**

Implement Gemini provider adapter.

### **Step 5**

Create tool interface and registry.

### **Step 6**

Implement Read File.

### **Step 7**

Implement Search.

### **Step 8**

Perform failure analysis.

### **Step 20**

Fix MVP issues.

### **Step 21**

Run the evaluation again.

### **Step 22**

Accept Iteration 1 only when the acceptance criteria are satisfied.

After each step, update `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` with:

* Completed checklist items  
* Current status  
* Files changed  
* Tests run  
* Any blockers  
* The next action

---

# **34\. Definition of Done**

Iteration 1 is **DONE** only when this scenario works:

User  
 |  
 | "Fix this bug"  
 v  
CLI  
 |  
 v  
Agent  
 |  
 v  
LLM

Verified Final Result

The system must perform this flow against a real repository.

`IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` must show every required task as completed, with no unresolved blockers, before Iteration 1 is accepted.

# **35\. Learning Outcome**

At the end of Iteration 1, we should be able to answer from our own implementation:

1. What is an agent loop?  
2. How does an LLM request a tool?  
3. How does the tool result return to the LLM?  
4. How does the agent decide its next action?  
5. How does the agent know when to stop?  
6. How do we prevent infinite loops?  
7. How do we restrict dangerous actions?  
8. How does the agent inspect a repository without reading everything?  
9. How does the agent verify its changes?  
10. How much context/tokens does a simple coding task consume?  
11. Where does the agent fail?  
12. Which failures come from the model and which come from our agent design?  
13. How can another coding agent resume interrupted work from the progress checklist?  
14. Which implementation steps are complete, pending, blocked, or partially complete?

These questions are more important than adding more features.

# **36\. Next Iteration Decision**

After Iteration 1, **do not automatically start Iteration 2**.

First review:

* Evaluation success rate  
* Failure categories  
* Token usage  
* Tool usage  
* Context size  
* Repeated actions  
* Verification failures  
* Developer experience  
* Completeness of `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`

Then select the next component based on the observed problems.

The next iteration will most likely address **context management**, but this decision should be supported by Iteration 1 evidence.
